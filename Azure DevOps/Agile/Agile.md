## What is Agile Methodology?

Agile methodology is a project management and product development approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, customer-centricity, and iterative progress. It focuses on delivering value to customers through small, incremental releases, with continuous feedback and adaptation throughout the development lifecycle.

Key principles of Agile include:
1. **Individuals and Interactions**: Over processes and tools.
2. **Working Software**: Over comprehensive documentation.
3. **Customer Collaboration**: Over contract negotiation.
4. **Responding to Change**: Over following a fixed plan.

Agile frameworks include **Scrum**, **Kanban**, **Extreme Programming (XP)**, and **SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework)**.

## Differences Between Waterfall and Agile Methodology

| **Aspect**          | **Waterfall**                                     | **Agile**                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Approach**         | Sequential, linear phases (e.g., Design → Build → Test) | Iterative, incremental development cycles (Sprints/Iterations) |
| **Flexibility**      | Rigid; difficult to accommodate changes once the process begins | Flexible; changes are welcomed even late in development |
| **Customer Involvement** | Limited to the requirement and delivery phases       | Continuous involvement and feedback throughout      |
| **Delivery**         | Final product delivered at the end of the project | Functional increments delivered frequently          |
| **Testing**          | Happens after development is complete             | Continuous testing during each sprint/iteration     |
| **Documentation**    | Heavy reliance on upfront documentation           | Lightweight documentation focused on current needs  |
| **Risk Management**  | High risk; issues often discovered late in the cycle | Low risk; early detection through iterative testing |
| **Team Collaboration** | Siloed teams with distinct roles                 | Cross-functional, collaborative teams               |
| **Best Suited For**  | Projects with clear, fixed requirements           | Projects with evolving requirements and high uncertainty |

## What is Agile Methodology?
Waterfall methodology is a linear and sequential approach to project management and software development. It is one of the oldest and most traditional methods, where each phase of the project is completed before the next phase begins, without overlapping or iteration.
