## What is Docker Compose?
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to configure multiple services, networks, and volumes in a single file, and then start all these components with a single command. The configuration is done using a YAML file, typically named docker-compose.yml.

## Use Cases of Docker Compose
**Multi-Container Applications**: When you have applications that consist of multiple services (e.g., a web server, a database, and a cache), Docker Compose allows you to manage them together.
Development Environments: Easily replicate complex environments for development purposes.

**Testing**: Set up test environments that mimic production systems.
**Deployment**: Define a consistent deployment environment for staging or production.

## Basic Components of Docker Compose

**Services**: Defines the containers that will be run. Each service can be a separate container.

**Networks**: Defines custom networks for services to communicate with each other.

**Volumes**: Defines data storage options for persisting data across container restarts.

## Example Scenario: Multi-Tier Web Application
Suppose you are developing a web application that requires a frontend web server, a backend API server, and a database. You can use Docker Compose to manage these components.
```yml
version: '3'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - ./web:/usr/share/nginx/html
    depends_on:
      - api

  api:
    image: my-api-image
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://db:5432/mydatabase
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:latest
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: exampleuser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: examplepassword
      POSTGRES_DB: mydatabase
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:

```
