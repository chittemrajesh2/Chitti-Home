# IT Delivery Methods: Agile, Scaled Agile, and Waterfall

## Overview of IT Delivery Methods

### Agile
An iterative approach to software development emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Agile methodologies break projects into smaller, manageable parts called iterations or sprints, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements quickly.

### Scaled Agile
This extends Agile principles to larger organizations or complex projects. It incorporates frameworks like the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) to maintain agility while coordinating multiple teams working on interconnected projects.

### Waterfall
A traditional, linear approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins. It is structured and often used in projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change.

## Deep Dive into Agile Methodology

### Key Principles of Agile
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Delivering valuable software early and continuously.
- **Welcoming Change**: Adapting to changing requirements even late in development.
- **Frequent Delivery**: Regularly delivering working software.
- **Collaboration**: Close cooperation between business stakeholders and developers.
- **Motivated Teams**: Building projects around motivated individuals.
- **Face-to-Face Communication**: The most effective method for conveying information.

### Agile Frameworks
- **Scrum**: Focuses on delivering work in time-boxed iterations called sprints, with defined roles (Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team).
- **Kanban**: Visualizes work in progress and limits work items at each stage of the process.
- **Extreme Programming (XP)**: Emphasizes technical practices and customer involvement.

## Most Asked Interview Questions and Answers

1. **What is Agile?**
   - Agile is a methodology that promotes iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams. It emphasizes flexibility and customer satisfaction.

2. **What are the main roles in Scrum?**
   - The three main roles are:
     - **Scrum Master**: Facilitates the process and removes impediments.
     - **Product Owner**: Represents stakeholders and prioritizes the backlog.
     - **Development Team**: Responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments of the product.

3. **What is a Daily Stand-Up meeting?**
   - A Daily Stand-Up is a short meeting where team members discuss what they accomplished yesterday, what they plan to do today, and any blockers they face.

4. **What is the difference between Agile and Waterfall?**
   - Agile is iterative and allows for changes throughout development, whereas Waterfall is a linear approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

5. **What is a Sprint?**
   - A Sprint is a time-boxed period during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review.

6. **What do you mean by "velocity" in Agile?**
   - Velocity measures how much work a team can complete in a single sprint, helping to predict future performance.

7. **Why is automated testing encouraged in Agile?**
   - Automated testing allows for faster feedback cycles and ensures that changes do not break existing functionality, facilitating quicker releases.

8. **What challenges might you face when implementing Agile?**
   - Common challenges include resistance to change, insufficient tools or skills, lack of customer involvement, and difficulties in managing team dynamics.
