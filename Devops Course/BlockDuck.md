# Black Duck Integration with Azure Pipelines

## Introduction to Black Duck

**Black Duck** is a leading Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that helps organizations manage the security, license compliance, and code quality of open-source components used in their applications. In today's software development landscape, where open-source software is widely used, it's crucial to ensure that these components are secure and compliant with legal requirements. Black Duck integrates with CI/CD pipelines, such as those in Azure DevOps, to provide automated scanning and reporting, ensuring that vulnerabilities and compliance issues are identified and addressed early in the development process.

### Key Features:
- **Vulnerability Detection:** Identifies known vulnerabilities in open-source components and provides remediation guidance.
- **License Compliance:** Tracks the licenses associated with open-source components to ensure compliance with your organizationâ€™s policies.
- **Policy Management:** Allows the creation and enforcement of security and compliance policies.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Offers detailed reports on vulnerabilities, license risks, and component usage.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Provides ongoing monitoring of open-source components for newly discovered vulnerabilities.

## Black Duck Integration with Azure DevOps

Integrating Black Duck with Azure DevOps involves adding Black Duck scanning tasks to your CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated scanning of code and built artifacts. This ensures that any issues related to open-source components are detected and addressed before the software is deployed.

### Steps for Integration:

1. **Install Black Duck Extension:**
   - Install the Black Duck extension from the Azure DevOps marketplace. This extension provides tasks that can be used within your pipelines to perform Black Duck scans.

2. **Configure Service Connection:**
   - Create a service connection in Azure DevOps that allows the pipeline to communicate with the Black Duck server. This requires the URL of the Black Duck server and credentials with appropriate permissions.

3. **Add Black Duck Task to Pipeline:**
   - Modify your Azure Pipeline YAML file to include the Black Duck scan task. You can specify different scan types (e.g., full scan, rapid scan) based on your needs.

   ```yaml
   - task: BlackDuck@1
     inputs:
       serviceConnection: 'blackduck-connection'
       scanType: 'full'
       projectName: 'my-project'
       version: '1.0.0'
